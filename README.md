Ideas for level concepts:
freezing yourself to wait for a moving platform
spidermanning up walls w grappling hook
releasing grappling hook early to slingshot yourself
  grappling up and down across the screen flappy bird style
using moving platforms to position into narrow tunnels with freeze/hook
start player falling onto bounce pad that activates laser
room of lasers, few safe spots
Elevator when you attach to a platform above you with the grapple and have to freeze/unfreeze to the timing of lasers that stretch across the elevator's path
